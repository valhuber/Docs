The fastest way to explore API Logic Server - *with __no install__* - is to follow this guide to create, explore and customize a project using Codespaces.

<details markdown>

<summary>What is API Logic Server</summary>

API Logic Server creates __customizable database web app projects:__

* Creation is __Instant:__ create _executable_ projects from your database, with a _single_ command.  Projects are __Highly Functional,__ providing:

    * __API:__ an endpoint for each table, with filtering, sorting, pagination and related data access

    * __Admin UI:__ multi-page / multi-table apps, with page navigations, automatic joins and declarative hide/show

* __Projects are Customizable, using _your IDE_:__ such as VSCode, PyCharm, etc, for familiar edit/debug services

* __Business Logic Automation:__ using unique spreadsheet-like rules, extensible with Python :trophy:

Follow the steps below to be up and running in about a minute - no install, no configuration.  You can run the created project to explore its functionality, and how to customize it in VSCode.

<summary>Why Does It Matter: Faster, Simpler, Modern Architecture</summary>

<details markdown>

<summary>Frameworks are too slow, Low Code is not dev-friendly</summary>

We looked at approaches for building database systems:   

* __Frameworks:__ Frameworks like Flask or Django enable you to build a single endpoint or _Hello World_ page, but a __multi-endpoint__ API and __multi-page__ application would take __weeks__ or more.

* __Low Code Tools:__ these are great for building great UIs, but

    * Want a multi-page app, _instantly_ -- __no layout required each screen__
    * Want to __preserve standard dev tools__ (VSCode, PyCharm, git, etc) - propietary IDEs are not dev-friendly

And neither provides an answer for __backend business logic__ (it's nearly half the effort).

<summary>API Logic Server - dev-friendly low-code automation</summary>


API Logic Server is a low-code, developer-friendly approach that leverages automation to dramatically improve web app development:

* Automation makes it __faster:__ _moments_, instead of weeks or months.  Unblock UI Dev, and engage business users - _early_ - to reduce misunderstandings.  _Customize_ with __standard IDEs.__

* Automation makes it __simpler:__ this reduces the risk of architectural errors, e.g., APIs without pagination.

* Automation ensures a __modern software architecture:__ _container-ready_, _API-based_, with _shared logic_ over UIs and APIs (no more logic in UI controllers), in maintainable _models_.

## 1. Open in Codespaces

No install is required - this runs in the cloud, via your Browser, courtesy Codespaces.  Use your existing GitHub account (no signup is required), and:

1. [__Click here__](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=526240678){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to open the *Create Codespace* page.

2. Configure as desired, and click __Create codespace__.

>  This process takes about a minute.  Wait until you see the port created.

<details markdown>

<summary>What Is Happening</summary>

You will now see the template project - open in VSCode, _in the Browser._  But that's just what you _see..._

Behind the scenes, Codespaces has requisitioned a cloud machine, and loaded the template - with a _complete development environment_ - Python, your dependencies, git, etc.

You are attached to this machine in your Browser, running VSCode.

These instructions are now visible in VS Code, to minimize window switching.


> :trophy: Pretty remarkable.

</details>

<details markdown>

<summary>Verify it worked</summary>

VSCode will open in your Browser, and the project will perform various initialization tasks.  After about 1 minute, verify as follows:

1. Port is created
2. Port made public
3. `readme` opened, showing next step

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/apilogicserver/wiki/images/git-codespaces/verify-codespaces.png?raw=true"></figure>

</details>

These instructions will continue in Codespaces in the `readme.md` (double-click it if it does not open automatically).

&nbsp;

## 2. Create a project

Wait a bit for initialization to complete, then paste this into the Terminal window (lower right):

```
ApiLogicServer create --project_name=./ --db_url=
```

When prompted, _do **not** rebuild the container._

<details markdown>

<summary>What Just Happened</summary>

This is **not** a coded application.

The system examined your database (here, the default), and __created an _executable project:___

* __API__ - an endpoint for each table, with full CRUD services, filtering, sorting, pagination and related data access

* __Admin UI__ - multi-page / multi-table apps, with page navigations and automatic joins

__Projects are Customizable, using _your IDE_:__ the Project Explorer shows the project structure.  Use the code editor to customize your project, and the debugger to debug it.

__Business Logic is Automated:__ use unique spreadsheet-like rules to declare multi-table derivations and constraints - 40X more concise than code.  Extend logic with Python.

<details markdown>

<summary>Using your own database</summary>

In this case, we used a default Customers/Orders database.  To use your own database, provide the `db_url` [like this](../Database-Connectivity/).

</details>
</details>

&nbsp;

## 3. Start Server, Admin App

The project is ready to run.

Use the prebuilt Run Configuration to start the server, and the prebuilt Port to start the web app.

<details markdown>

<summary>Show Me How</summary>

As shown below:

1. Use the default __Run Configuration__ to start the server, and 

2. Click __Ports > Globe__ to start the web app.

&nbsp;

## 4. Explore the Tutorial

[Open the Tutorial](Tutorial.md) to explore the sample project.

<details markdown>

<summary>Tutorial Overview</summary>

The Tutorial will enable you to explore 2 key aspects:

* __Initial Automation__ - API and UI creation are automated from the data model. So, later, you'd see this level of automation for your own databases.

* __Customization and Debugging__ - this sample also includes customizations for extending the API and declaring logic, and how to use VSCode to debug these.  The Tutorial will clearly identify such pre-built customizations.

# API Logic Server Background

### Motivation

We looked at approaches for building database systems:  

<br/>

__Frameworks__

Frameworks like Flask or Django enable you to build a single endpoint or _Hello World_ page, but a __multi-endpoint__ API and __multi-page__ application would take __weeks__ or more.

<br/>

__Low Code Tools__

These are great for building great UIs, but

* Want a multi-page app -- __without requiring detail layout for each screen__
* Want to __preserve standard dev tools__ - VSCode, PyCharm, git, etc
* Need an answer for __backend logic__ (it's nearly half the effort)

&nbsp;

### Our Approach: Instant, Standards-based Customization, Logic Automation

API Logic Server is an open source Python project.  It runs as a standard Python (`pip`) install, or under Docker. It consists of:

* a set of runtimes (api, user interface, data access) for project execution, plus 

* a CLI (Command Language Interface) to create executable projects with a single command

Then,

* Customize your projects in standard IDEs such as VSCode or PyCharm

* Declare multi-table derivation and constraint logic using spreadsheet-like rules

    * :trophy: 40X more concise than code
    * Extend with Python


> :bulb: API Logic Server reads your schema, and creates an executable, customizable project.
