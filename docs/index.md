# Welcome to API Logic Server - Docs, V8.0

API Logic Server creates __customizable database web app projects:__

* Creation is __Instant:__ create _executable_ projects from your database with a _single_ command.  Projects are __Highly Functional,__ providing:

    * __API:__ an endpoint for each table, with filtering, sorting, pagination and related data access

    * __Admin UI:__ multi-page / multi-table apps, with page navigations, automatic joins and declarative hide/show

* __Projects are Customizable, using _your IDE_:__ such as VSCode, PyCharm, etc, for familiar edit/debug services

* __Business Logic Automation:__ using unique spreadsheet-like rules, extensible with Python :trophy:

&nbsp;

### Why It Matters: Faster, Simpler, Modern Architecture

API Logic Server can dramatically improve web app development:

* Automation makes it __faster:__ what used to require weeks or months is now immediate.  Unblock UI Dev, and engage business users - _early_ - instead of investing in a misunderstanding.

* Automation makes it __simpler:__ this reduces the risk of architectural errors, e.g., APIs without pagination.

* Automation guarantees a __modern software architecture:__ _container-ready_, _API-based_, with _shared logic_ between UIs and APIs (no more logic in UI controllers), in a predictable structure for maintenance.

### Quick Evaluation - _no install_

You can avoid install hassles by exploring the [Sample Project in Codespaces](Install-Eval).  This will enable you to use VSCode - _in your Browser, zero install_ - to:

* Create a project using the supplied sample database
* Examine the created project in VSCode (in your Browser)
* Use the Tutorial to run, customize and debug it 

We think you'll find Codespaces pretty amazing - check it out!

# Background
A brief look at why we built it, and our approach.<br><br>

### Motivation - not instant, proprietary IDE, no logic automation

We looked at approaches for building database systems:   

* __Frameworks:__ Frameworks like Flask or Django enable you to build a single endpoint or _Hello World_ page, but a __multi-endpoint__ API and __multi-page__ application would take __weeks__ or more.

* __Low Code Tools:__ these are great for building great UIs, but

    * Want a multi-page app, _instantly_ -- __no layout required each screen__
    * Want to __preserve dev tools__ - VSCode, PyCharm, git, etc
    * Need an answer for __backend business logic__ (it's nearly half the effort)<br><br>


### Our Approach: Instant, Customizable, Logic Automation

API Logic Server is an open source Python project, consisting of:

* a set of runtimes (SAFRS API, Flask, SQLAlchemy ORM, business logic engine) for project execution, plus 

* a CLI (Command Language Interface) to create executable projects, which can be customized in an IDE such as VSCode or PyCharm

It runs as a standard pip install, or under Docker. After installation, you use the CLI create a project like this:

```
ApiLogicServer create --project_name=ApiLogicProject db_url=
```

    API Logic Server reads your schema, and creates an executable, customizable project providing the features listed below.  Check it out [here](Install-Express){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

# Instant -- Single Command

Use the CLI to create the sample API and Admin App project, with a single command.

&nbsp;

### Create With Docker

Execute the following commands (Windows, use Windows Terminal or Powershell):

```bash title="Run API Logic Server in Docker"
# Start the API Logic Server docker container
docker run -it --name api_logic_server --rm -p 5656:5656 -p 5002:5002 -v ${PWD}:/localhost apilogicserver/api_logic_server

ApiLogicServer create-and-run --project_name=/localhost/ApiLogicProject --db_url=
```
&nbsp;

### Or, Create With Local Install
Presuming Python 3.7+ [is installed](Install){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, it's typically:

```bash title="Run API Logic Server from a local pip install"
python -m venv venv        # may require python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # windows venv\Scripts\activate
venv\Scripts\activate      # mac/linux: source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install ApiLogicServer

ApiLogicServer create --project_name=ApiLogicProject --db_url=  # or, create-and-run
python ApiLogicProject/api_logic_server_run.py                  # run the server
```
&nbsp;

## Execute

Your system is running - explore the data and api at [localhost:5656](http://localhost:5656).  Using the defaults provided above, you have started the [Tutorial](Tutorial/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the recommended quick start for API Logic Server.

&nbsp;

# Customize in IDE

VSCode and PyCharm users can customize and run/debug within their IDE with [these steps](IDE-Execute){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  Created projects include Launch and Docker configurations.  

![Image title](images/generated-project.png){ align=left }

[Rebuild services](https://valhuber.github.io/ApiLogicServer/Project-Rebuild/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} are provided to accommodate changes to database structure or ORM classes.

&nbsp;

# Overview Video

Project creation is based on database schema introspection as shown below: identify a database, and the ```ApiLogicServer create``` commands creates an executable, customomizable project.

# Getting Started

### Local Install

API Logic Server is designed to make it easy to get started:

* **Install and run Tutorial** - 
[install](https://valhuber.github.io/ApiLogicServer/Install-Express/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and explore the [tutorial](https://valhuber.github.io/ApiLogicServer/Tutorial/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  You'll create a complete project using the pre-installed sample database, explore its features, and support for customization and debugging. 

* **Installed Sample Databases** -
Here are [some installed sample databases](Data-Model-Examples){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

* **Dockerized Test Databases** - 
Then, you might like to try out some of our [dockerized test databases](https://valhuber.github.io/ApiLogicServer/Database-Connectivity/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

* **Your Database** - 
Finally, try your own database.

&nbsp;

# Use Cases

There are a variety of ways for getting value from API Logic Server:

* __Create and Customize database web apps__ - the core target of the project

* __Admin App for your database__ - the Admin App is a create way to navigate through your database, particularly to explore data relationships

* __Data Repair__ - using the Admin App with logic to ensure integrity, repair data for which you may not have had time to create custom apps

* __Project Creation__ - even if you do not intend to use the API, Admin App or logic, you can use API Logic Server to create project you then edit by hand.  Created projects will include the SQLAlchemy Data Models, and project structure

* __Learning__ - explore the [Learning Center](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to learn about key concepts of Flask and SQLAlchemy
