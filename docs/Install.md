## Install in Docker or Locally

You can install API Logic Server locally using `pip`, using Docker, or pythonanywhere (a cloud service).

  > While `pip` is a simple install, it requires a Python environment, which is _not_ so simple.  We therefore recommend you consider Docker - it's a simpler install, and aligns you with a likely deployment environment.

__Create an install directory__

You can create this anywhere, such as your home folder or Desktop.

```bash title="Create an install directory"
mkdir ApiLogicServer      # a directory of projects on your local machine
```
Then, open the appropriate section below, and see the [Installation Notes](#installation-notes), below.

=== "Local Install"

    API Logic Server requires Python 3.8 or higher, since it relies on `from future import annotations`.

    The first section below verifies whether your Python environment is current.  

    The following section explains how to install a current Python environment.

    __Verify Pre-reqs: Python 3.8+__

    Ensure you have these pre-reqs:

    ```bash title="Verify 3.8 - 3.10"
    python --version

    python -m venv -h  # also verify these work
    python -m pip -h
    ```
      > Note: on Macs, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

    If you need to install Python (it can be tricky), see [these notes](../Tech-Install-Python).
    &nbsp;

    __Install API Logic Server in a virtual environment__

    Then, install API Logic Server in the usual manner:

    ```bash title="Install API Logic Server in a Virtual Environment"
    cd ApiLogicServer                    # directory of your choice
    python -m venv venv                  # may require python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate             # windows venv\Scripts\activate
    python -m pip install ApiLogicServer
    ```

    If you are using SqlServer, you also need to [install `pyodbc`](../Install-pyodbc).

=== "With Docker"

    ```bash title="Start (might install) API Logic Server Docker"
    cd ApiLogicServer      # a directory of projects on local host

    # Start (install if required) the API Logic Server docker container...

    docker run -it --name api_logic_server --rm -p 5656:5656 -p 5002:5002 -v ${PWD}:/localhost apilogicserver/api_logic_server
    ```

    This will start a command line in the Docker container at your current directory.
    You are now able to issue commands like `ApiLogicServer create` as described in the home page.  These will create API Logic Projects as directories under your current directory.

    > Windows: use Powershell (`PWD` is not supported in Command Line)

    > API Logic Projects are _not_ restricted to be under the same directory.

    The `api_logic_server` image supports startup arguments so you can control the `api_logic_server` container, by running a startup script or by supplying environment variables.  You might, for example, have automated test procedures that load projects from `GitHub` and run tests.

    For more information, see [Working With Docker](../Working-With-Docker).

    > Already installed?  Upgrade to the latest (5.03.10): ```docker pull apilogicserver/api_logic_server``` (you may need to [rebuild your container](https://valhuber.github.io/ApiLogicServer/Execute-VSCode-Docker/)).

=== "PythonAnyWhere"

    You can create an ApiLogicServer on [PythonAnywhere](http://pythonanywhere.com) for any cloud-accessible database. Â Open a bash console, and:

    ```bash  
    python3 -m venv venv  # ensures that Python3 is used  
    source venv/bin/activate

    python3 -m pip install ApiLogicServer

    ApiLogicServer create --host=ApiLogicServer.pythonanywhere.com --port=   # ApiLogicServer == your account  
    ```

    __1. Create Application__

    Here is an example using a pythonanywhere-hosted MySQL database (__note__ the escape character for the $ in the database name:  
    ```  
    ApiLogicServer create --project_name=Chinook \
    --host=ApiLogicServer.pythonanywhere.com --port= \
    --db_url=mysql+pymysql://ApiLogicServer:***@ApiLogicServer.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com/ApiLogicServer\$Chinook
    ```

    __2. Create and configure a web app__

    <figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/apilogicserver/wiki/images/python-anywhere.png?raw=true"></figure>

    __3. Update the wsgi__
    And copy the contents of ```/home/ApiLogicServer/api_logic_server/python_anywhere_wsgi.py``` over the wsgi file created by pythonanywhere.

    __4. Update the Admin App `api_root`__
    The first few lines of the Admin.yaml and Admin Config page should be (update the last line:
    ```
    about:
      date: December 26, 2021 09:00:00
      recent_changes: altered tab captions
      version: 3.50.51
    api_root: https://apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com/api
    ```

    __5. Verify `admin.yaml`__
    Verify that the `ui/admin.yaml` ends with something like this:

    ```bash
    settings:
      HomeJS: https://apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com/admin-app/home.js
      max_list_columns: 8
    ```
    __6. Configure the host and port__

    In `api_logic_server_run.py`, set these as follows:

    ```python
    host = "apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com"  # was "localhost"
    port = ""                                   # was "5656"
    ```
    __7. Restart the Web App__
    You start ApiLogicServer from the web console, *not* from the command line

    __8. Run the application__

    You can open the Admin App in your browser [http://apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com/admin-app/index.html](http://apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com/admin-app/index.html).


    You can use ```curl``` from pythonanywhere consoles:  
    ```  
    curl -X GET "http://ApiLogicServer.pythonanywhere.com/api/employees/?include=office%2Cparent%2CEmployeeList%2CCustomerList&fields%5BEmployee%5D=employeeNumber%2ClastName%2CfirstName%2Cextension%2Cemail%2CofficeCode%2CreportsTo%2CjobTitle&page%5Boffset%5D=0&page%5Blimit%5D=10&sort=employeeNumber%2ClastName%2CfirstName%2Cextension%2Cemail%2CofficeCode%2CreportsTo%2CjobTitle%2Cid" -H  "accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H  "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json"  
    ```

## Installation Notes

### Alert - Project fails to start

Recent updates to included libs have broken previous versions of API Logic Server.  This is fixed in a new version (5.00.06), and is strongly recommended.  You can also repair broken installations as described in [Troubleshooting](../Troubleshooting).

### Heads up - Certificate Issues
We sometimes see Python / Flask AppBuilder Certificate issues - see [Troubleshooting](../Troubleshooting#certificate-failures).

### Default Python version
In some cases, your computer may have multiple Python versions, such as ```python3```.  ```ApiLogicServer run``` relies on the default Python being 3.8 or higher.  You can resolve this by:
* making ```python3``` the default Python, or
* using ```ApiLogicServer create```, and running ```python3 api_logic_server_run.py```
